Getting Ready to Code

Before we can start programming, you will need to have some tools to program with.

To start with, you'll need Git. If you use Windows, I recommend getting this 
as part of the Github desktop application:

https://desktop.github.com/

You'll need to create a Github account for yourself.
https://github.com/

Once you have an account, try the Github "Hello World" introduction.
https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/

This is a good video introduction to Git and Github: https://youtu.be/MJUJ4wbFm_A

Once you've completed these steps, clone the LetsMakeRobots repository to your
machine, add some text to the file Log.txt, and submit a pull request with
your changes.
The repository is: https://github.com/KentridgeRobotics/LetsMakeRobots

Next, you will need a development environment. This means, at least, that you
will have a computer with a text editor and a compiler installed on it. It's fine
to use Windows, Linux, or Mac, since all have excellent development tools.

There are three programming languages that seem to be most popular for programming
robots: Java, Python, and C++. Learning to solve problems in any of these languages,
and to write clear and readable code, is excellent preparation for the kinds of
programming challenges that you will encounter while building a robot. 

On Windows, I recommend using Visual Studio Community 2017, which contains both compiler
and editor and is freely available here:
https://www.visualstudio.com/
Under "Download Visual Studio", select "Community 2017". When installing, choose Workload
of "Desktop development with C++", then hit "Install".

On Linux, I like either Emacs or Vim for editors, and g++ for a compiler, and I think
that these are also available on Mac. (XCode is probably more popular on the Mac, but
I haven't used it much.)

In any case, get computer prepared by installing a development environment.

First coding assignment

It sounds like C++ is going to be used for at least some of our programming
in the next build season. So let's get familiar with it. Read through the short guide to C++ here,
and do the exercises:

For more in-depth information, these are good starting links as introductions to C++:
